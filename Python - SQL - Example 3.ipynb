    "This is an individual homework assignment. This means that:\n",
    "* You may discuss the problems in this assignment with other students in this course and your instructor/TA, but YOUR WORK MUST BE YOUR OWN.\n",
    "* Do not show other students code or your own work on this assignment.\n",
    "* You may consult external references, but not actively receive help from individuals not involved in this course. \n",
    "* Cite all references outside of the course you used, including conversations with other students which were helpful. (This helps us give credit where it is due!). All references must use a commonly accepted reference format, for example, APA or IEEE (or another citation style of your choice).\n",

This is because \"Nearby\" is nested within each \"Hospital\" entry, which itself is nested inside \"Facilities.\" This requires me looking into each level of access, making it diffult to flatten consistently with a single operation. \"Nearby\" also has varying formats across entries—it may contain a list of dictionaries (e.g., names of nearby facilities) or just a single string. This inconsistency complicates data extraction, as handling each format requires different approaches. So it may take a little bit to figure out how to pull it correctly from the file. This is also similar to \"Location\" for the companies."

    " I felt like the most uncomfortable part of the assignment was opening up nested JSON files in a consistent way. I could have indexed given that each value in the table had the same structure, but, for example, since some entries like \"nearby hospitals\" had their own dictionaries, it was hard to stay consistent and I had to find alternative methods. I think it was uncomfortable for me as I have never really worked with JSON files before, and most of the time data I work with is saved in CSV files. This assignment really exposed me to JSON and its complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    " The reason this part was challenging is that I had gaps in my understaning on how to  navigating and manipulating nested structures, especially in JSON format. I realized that I need to build more skills in handling non-tabular data, particularly when it comes to extracting and transforming nested elements into more familiar formats.\n",
    "\n",
    " Using pandas for this assignment was helpful but had its limitations for understanding JSON structures deeply. Pandas provides some useful methods to handle JSON data, like json_normalize, which can simplify the process of flattening out nested data. However, these methods only go so far when the JSON structure is complex or deeply nested. While pandas made certain parts of the process smoother, i really took long ways to do a lot of the work and still feel like i can simplify this, which i will take on and continue to learn about."
