This is evident when observing artists who create diverse types of art, such as Artist 3, who produces both sculptures and two-dimensional artworks using different materials. Since the biography is directly tied to the artist, it similarly doesn’t affect the artwork type. Lastly, regarding the country, we see that countries with multiple artworks exhibit a variety of materials and types. Only countries with a single painting show any impact, but those with more follow trends similar to the USA and Canada."

For Dataset 1 (artworks), I would create separate tables for Ownership and Site. The Ownership table would store details such as OwnershipID and  OwnershipType , and this would be linked to the  Artwork  table through  OwnershipID . Similarly, I would extract site-related information into a new  Site  table, including fields like  SiteID ,  SiteName , and  SiteAddress , which would connect to the  Artwork  table via  SiteID . This way, the  Artwork  table no longer contains information that depends only on part of the composite key. For Dataset 2 (artists), I would also normalize by breaking down the artist's details like  Biography ,  Country , and  Photos  into their own tables, linking them by  ArtistID . I would rather normalize it to 2NF beaucse the data set is not that complex and by moving to 2NF, the data would be more efficient, with less redundancy and clearer relationships between the tables. This structure would ensure that all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key, making it easier to update data while maintaining integrity.\n"

If you're focused on the number of artworks created by artists with detailed information like first and last names, you'd look at the artist table merged with the art table. However, if you're interested in determining where the artists who contributed to the artworks in the art table are from, you can explore that, but keep in mind the artist dataset is missing many artists that appear in the art table.\n",

    "Other limitations stem from how the data is stored. It should be cleaned up further— for example, latitude and longitude should not be merged into a single column but rather kept as separate columns to facilitate easy geospatial analysis.

    "**Answer** I joined the ArtistID from the artist table with the 'Artist' field in the artwork table. This is because the artist ID is unqiue to each artist and since the artwork table has multiple artworks form one artist, its easier to pull from a single sourse of truth, which is artist table. However, the type of join depends on the question being asked. For example, if the query asks for the names of artist and their country of orgin, you would join using the ArtistID and include all relevant data from the artwork table, as it contains information about all the artists who contributed to the artworks."

You’d just use the find function and filter by the variables you want, like ***\"Country\": { \"$in\": [\"Canada\", \"USA\"] }***, and then keep filtering further.

    "1. I feel much more confident with SQL queries now. While I've used them before, I really needed a refresher, especially for more complex queries. I've also learned a lot more about the different types of database management systems. I wasn't very familiar with the various types, aside from their names, but now I feel I can describe them fairly well, though I still need improvement in using them effectively. Another area where I’ve made progress is in coding overall—specifically in identifying issues and breaking them down further.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I think the class was really helpful, especially in discussing the process. I enjoyed working through examples in class and being able to ask questions about why things were done a certain way. The project also pushed us to really dive in and learn around how to use the things we did in class, which I appreciated as its more hands on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. I definitely see myself developing a stronger understanding of MongoDB. It's something new for me, and while it doesn’t seem too complex, I’m eager to get more comfortable with it and learn more. On the other hand, I can continue to improve my knowledge of theoretical concepts like normalization, and I’ll keep putting effort into learning those. However, again i feel like i can always get better at coding, and will use the break to continue at it!\n",
